# Categorizing movie genres by their posters
Implemented as a notebook, using tensorflow, I built a convolutional neural network able to categorize a movie by its poster with circa 65% accuracy.

### Dataset choice
You can choose wheter to download and use the full dataset or use a smaller made-by-me subset, from the first variable of the notebook.

Note that a kaggle account and an api key token are needed for the full dataset.
Check how to get an api key token from here: [Kaggle api authentication](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api#authentication).

Otherwise, the small testing subset is freely available from Hugging Face.
